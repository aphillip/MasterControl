Master Control can be compiled with Apache Ant.  Once Ant is installed
on the system, and is in the system path, run:

ant


from the this folder. This command will list all the possible build 
commands to compile the program.  In general, the command:

ant build

should be used.  It will compile and execute the program. The file 
build.bat can also be used to perform this function.
